# Compositor

A fast, focused image compositor for macOS — layers and folders, masks, non-destructive transforms, brushes, selections, adjustments and filters.

## Requirements

- macOS 26
- Xcode 26

## Building

Open `Compositor.xcodeproj` and run the **Compositor** scheme.

## Releasing

`scripts/release.sh` builds a Release version, signs it with Developer ID, notarizes and staples it, and packages it into `dist/Compositor-<version>.dmg`.

It needs, all kept outside this repository:

- a **Developer ID Application** certificate in the login keychain
- notarization credentials saved with `xcrun notarytool store-credentials "compositor-notary" …`
- [`create-dmg`](https://github.com/create-dmg/create-dmg) (`brew install create-dmg`)
